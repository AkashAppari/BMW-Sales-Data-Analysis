# BMW Worldwide Sales Analysis (2010-2024)

## Project Overview and Goals
This data analysis project examines BMW's global sales performance from 2010 to 2024, with the following objectives:
- Identify key market trends and regional performance patterns
- Analyze vehicle preferences across different markets
- Assess the growth of electric vehicles in BMW's portfolio
- Provide actionable insights for market strategy

## Dataset Overview
The BMW Worldwide Sales Records dataset contains:
- **Time Period**: January 2010 - December 2024
- **Geographic Scope**: All major markets worldwide
- **Key Variables**:
  - Sales volume by model
  - Regional distribution
  - Vehicle segment classification
  - Powertrain type (ICE, PHEV, BEV)
  - Monthly sales figures
  - Market-specific pricing
  - Vehicle specifications

## Data Preprocessing
### Cleaning Steps
1. **Missing Value Treatment**:
   - Filled missing regional data using market hierarchy
   - Interpolated missing monthly sales using seasonal patterns
   - Removed records with >50% missing values (< 0.1% of dataset)

2. **Data Quality Improvements**:
   - Standardized model names and classifications
   - Corrected date formatting inconsistencies
   - Removed duplicate entries (found in overlapping regional reports)
   - Validated sales figures against public financial reports

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created market segment categories (Entry, Premium, Performance, Ultra-Luxury)
   - Derived vehicle type classifications
   - Calculated price categories and engine power tiers
   - Generated green vehicle indicators (Electric/Hybrid flags)
   - Computed market share and performance metrics
   - Validated all metrics against actual data:
     - Entry segment: 45.8%, Premium: 27.1%, Performance: 17.8%, Ultra-Luxury: 9.3%
     - Green vehicles: 50.4% of total sales
     - Price-sales correlation: 0.0 overall (near-zero elasticity)
